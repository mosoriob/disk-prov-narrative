A Cohort was sampled by querying the data sourrce: {{ dataSource }} by {{ dataQueryVariables }}. Additional metrics  {{ deltaQueryDelta }} were extracted from {{ deltaQueryDeltaLocations }}.
This query resulted in {{numberSetsReturned}} {{fileFormat}} datasets out of {{totalSets}} datasets available in the catalog.

{{numberSetsReturned}} {{fileFormat}} datasets were used as the input collection to the {{workflowName}}.

Additional required parameters {{workflowParameters}} were mapped to the values {{workflowValues}}. The optional parameters {{optionalParametersNotUsed}} were not used in the workflow.
{# The workflow resulted in a p value of {pValue}. The p value was derived by {user generated description}. {deltaNum} new datasets were added to the datasource which triggered this line of inquiry. Consequently the p value has changed from {pastPVal} to {newPVal} #}
